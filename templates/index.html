    <p>Quotes about Python:
        Python is used successfully in thousands of real-world business applications around the world,
        including many large and mission critical systems. Here are some quotes from happy Python users:</p>
    <p>YouTube.com:
        "Python is fast enough for our site and allows us to produce maintainable features in record times,
        with a minimum of developers," said Cuong Do, Software Architect, YouTube.com.</p>
    <p>Industrial Light & Magic:
        "Python plays a key role in our production pipeline. Without it a project the size of Star Wars:
        Episode II would have been very difficult to pull off. From crowd rendering to batch processing to compositing,
        Python binds all things together," said Tommy Burnette, Senior Technical Director, Industrial Light & Magic.
        "Python is everywhere at ILM. It's used to extend the capabilities of our applications, as well as providing the
        glue between them. Every CG image we create has involved Python somewhere in the process," said Philip Peterson,
        Principal Engineer, Research & Development, Industrial Light & Magic.</p>
    <p>Google:
        "Python has been an important part of Google since the beginning, and remains so as the system grows and
        evolves.
        Today dozens of Google engineers use Python, and we're looking for more people with skills in this language."
        said Peter Norvig, director of search quality at Google, Inc.</p>
